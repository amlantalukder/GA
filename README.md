Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------
Choosing the genetic operator types and tuning operator probabilities is an additional pre-processing step needed before running a genetic algorithm, especially since the choice varies with different problems and have significant effects on the output. To help with this issue, adaptive operator strategies were already proposed by various studies. Here we propose an extension on the adaptive operator strategy proposed by a previous study (Julstrom, 1995) which adapts the probability of the selected multiple operators for a problem based on how the operator contributed to the fitness values so far. We also report a better result than the original study using our extension.

1. run this command 
    "python codes/search.py <problem_name>.params"
2. use "1" as additional argument to print more details
    "python codes/search.py <problem_name>.params 1"

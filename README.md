Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------
This is a python implementation of the GA with adaptive operator strategy proposed by Julstorm, 1995.

How to run
---------------------------------------------------------
1. run this command 

            "python codes/search.py <problem_name>.params"

2. use "1" as additional argument to print more details

            "python codes/search.py <problem_name>.params 1"

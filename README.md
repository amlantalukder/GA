In a Steady State GA (SSGA), a new generation is created by replacingonly the worst fit member of the previous generationwith a new member. Since, crossover between twoparents can generate two children,here weimplemented the idea of SSGA by replacing theworst two members of the population, with thereproduced children of two randomly selectedindividuals, at every generation. In case of mutation,the two new members are generated by mutating the two selected individuals separately.

How to run
-----------------------------------------------------------
run this command "python codes/search.py <problem_name>.params"
use "1" as additional argument to print more details "python codes/search.py <problem_name>.params 1"
